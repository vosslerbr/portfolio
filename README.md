# My portfolio

This is my new and improved web development portfolio.

It's built with Vue 3 and Vite, and uses Strapi as a headless CMS for the backend.

There's even a dark mode toggle ðŸ¤ 

I hope you enjoy looking at it as much as I enjoyed building it, and you can definitely reach out to me if you'd like.

If you notice any problems, feel free to open a new issue here on GitHub.
